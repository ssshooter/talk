## Background

I built this slide from scratch based on how I wished to write these contents.
I also learned that sometimes not pursuing perfection would make my life much easier.

This slide **only** works in Chrome. However, **Chrome 73** has some performance issues.
Please use **Chrome Canary** or older versions of Chrome.
